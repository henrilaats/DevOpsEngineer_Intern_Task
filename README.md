### Aim of the task
The Python program pulls currency rates from the "https://currency-exchange.p.rapidapi.com/exchange" API, caches the currency rates, and allows the user to determine the best conversion for themselves and their customers. The program utilizes the Tkinter module for the graphical user interface, which may need to be installed beforehand.
